Soy Alvaro, un chico nacido en Madrid pero que ha vivido en el extranjero desde que prácticamente tiene uso de razón. Si, me gusta viajar, conocer nuevas culturas, enriquecerme de ellas adentrándome en lo más profundo de cada lugar.

Los principales motivos que me han llevado a vivir en California (1 año) y Londres (8 años) han sido meramente profesionales. Decidí que era lo mejor para formarme en el ámbito de la tecnología aplicada al marketing. Eso que decidí estudiar cuando era un niño y que me ha permitido crecer como persona.

Llevo hospedando a gente con Airbnb cerca de dos años y sinceramente disfruto mucho con ello,  tanto que me he dado cuenta me gustaría dar un vuelco a mi vida profesional y personal y empezar a trabajar en nuevo proyecto, un eco lodge. Esto permitirá unir mis pasiones por el hospedaje, la naturaleza, la salud, espiritualidad, la gente y porque no, el negocio sostenible.

Mientras sigo definiendo el proyecto desde Madrid, una ciudad bellísima por su gente, su comida, su historia y arquitectura, quisiera seguir nutriéndome de otras culturas, quizá, conociéndote ti y tú punto de vista sobre este mundo que compartimos.

It is located in front of the well-known San Fernando Market and a 10-minute walk from Plaza Mayor","The tourist area of Lavapiés is located southeast of the city's central almond. Like neighboring La Latina, its steep, narrow and irregularly woven streets retain their medieval origin as a suburb that extended outside the walls of the citadel when Madrid became capital of the kingdom in 1561.<br /><br />Lavapiés has since maintained its character as a neighborhood inhabited mostly by the popular classes of the city. This has given rise to buildings of a peculiar physiognomy: houses of various heights built around a central courtyard, called corralas, whose best example can be found at the confluence of the streets Tribulete and Mesón de Paredes.<br /><br />Lavapiés is one of the best examples of the chaste and sainetera tradition of the people of Madrid, which became popular in many of the zarzuelas written in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially in El barberillo de Lavapiés by Francisco Asenjo Barbieri.

Soy Alvaro, un chico nacido en Madrid pero que ha vivido en el extranjero desde que prácticamente tiene uso de razón. Si, me gusta viajar, conocer nuevas culturas, enriquecerme de ellas adentrándome en lo más profundo de cada lugar.

Los principales motivos que me han llevado a vivir en California (1 año) y Londres (8 años) han sido meramente profesionales. Decidí que era lo mejor para formarme en el ámbito de la tecnología aplicada al marketing. Eso que decidí estudiar cuando era un niño y que me ha permitido crecer como persona.

Llevo hospedando a gente con Airbnb cerca de dos años y sinceramente disfruto mucho con ello,  tanto que me he dado cuenta me gustaría dar un vuelco a mi vida profesional y personal y empezar a trabajar en nuevo proyecto, un eco lodge. Esto permitirá unir mis pasiones por el hospedaje, la naturaleza, la salud, espiritualidad, la gente y porque no, el negocio sostenible.

Mientras sigo definiendo el proyecto desde Madrid, una ciudad bellísima por su gente, su comida, su historia y arquitectura, quisiera seguir nutriéndome de otras culturas, quizá, conociéndote ti y tú punto de vista sobre este mundo que compartimos.

I love travelling, so I’m often absent. For me, the best way to get to know a city is by living there like a local person, and this can only be done, of course, by getting accommodation. It is with this in mind that whenever I am travelling, I make my lodging facility available to travelers from around the world, so: why not you?

Don’t worry, even if I’m not present when you are doing the booking arrangement, Luckey, Airbnb’s official concierge, to whom I have entrusted the management of my home, will make your stay as enjoyable as possible!

See you soon,

José Manuel. 

Estimados futuros huéspedes,

Me encanta viajar, así que a menudo estoy ausente. Para mí, la mejor manera de conocer una ciudad es viviendo allí como una persona local, y esto solo se puede hacer, por supuesto, obteniendo alojamiento. Es con esto en mente que cada vez que viajo, pongo mi alojamiento a disposición de viajeros de todo el mundo, entonces: ¿por qué no usted?

No se preocupe, incluso si no estoy presente cuando están haciendo el acuerdo de reserva, Luckey, el conserje oficial de Airbnb, a quien he confiado la administración de mi hogar, hará que su estadía sea lo más agradable posible.

Le veo pronto,

José Manuel.

I live with less and work from anywhere in the world. So far it has been 8 cities in 3 continents and counting! 

Though I'm a digital designer by profession, I love interior design and took the chance to renovate my mother's decades-old apartment during a trip back so she could live more comfortably. As you can imagine it wasn't an easy task, try telling your parents to throw that old clock stuck at ten to eleven or that weird looking boat that's supposed to bring luck into the family. But we worked out something in the end and I got to take down some walls, placed a new floor that keeps the house super cool in summer, and basically changed all the furniture in the house. 

That boat stayed on though. ;P

My mother is based in Madrid and has been working as a local tour guide for VIP groups from Asian countries and brings them all over Spain, sometimes even to Morocco, Portugal and France. Though tiring she loves her job and meeting people. My sister and I don't stay in Spain normally so she's happy to have company with at the apartment if she's not away on tour.

If you book with us please take care of the house and treat it as your own. I have prepared a guide to give you an overview of the city. If we are at home we'll be happy to help you with planning so you make the most of your stay in the city :)

I love travelling, so I’m often absent. For me, the best way to get to know a city is by living there like a local person, and this can only be done, of course, by getting accommodation. It is with this in mind that whenever I am travelling, I make my lodging facility available to travelers from around the world, so: why not you?

Don’t worry, even if I’m not present when you are doing the booking arrangement, Luckey, Airbnb’s official concierge, to whom I have entrusted the management of my home, will make your stay as enjoyable as possible!

See you soon,

José Manuel. 

Estimados futuros huéspedes,

Me encanta viajar, así que a menudo estoy ausente. Para mí, la mejor manera de conocer una ciudad es viviendo allí como una persona local, y esto solo se puede hacer, por supuesto, obteniendo alojamiento. Es con esto en mente que cada vez que viajo, pongo mi alojamiento a disposición de viajeros de todo el mundo, entonces: ¿por qué no usted?

No se preocupe, incluso si no estoy presente cuando están haciendo el acuerdo de reserva, Luckey, el conserje oficial de Airbnb, a quien he confiado la administración de mi hogar, hará que su estadía sea lo más agradable posible.

Le veo pronto,

I live with less and work from anywhere in the world. So far it has been 8 cities in 3 continents and counting! 

Though I'm a digital designer by profession, I love interior design and took the chance to renovate my mother's decades-old apartment during a trip back so she could live more comfortably. As you can imagine it wasn't an easy task, try telling your parents to throw that old clock stuck at ten to eleven or that weird looking boat that's supposed to bring luck into the family. But we worked out something in the end and I got to take down some walls, placed a new floor that keeps the house super cool in summer, and basically changed all the furniture in the house. 

That boat stayed on though. ;P

My mother is based in Madrid and has been working as a local tour guide for VIP groups from Asian countries and brings them all over Spain, sometimes even to Morocco, Portugal and France. Though tiring she loves her job and meeting people. My sister and I don't stay in Spain normally so she's happy to have company with at the apartment if she's not away on tour.

If you book with us please take care of the house and treat it as your own. I have prepared a guide to give you an overview of the city. If we are at home we'll be happy to help you with planning so you make the most of your stay in the city :)

I live with less and work from anywhere in the world. So far it has been 8 cities in 3 continents and counting! 

Though I'm a digital designer by profession, I love interior design and took the chance to renovate my mother's decades-old apartment during a trip back so she could live more comfortably. As you can imagine it wasn't an easy task, try telling your parents to throw that old clock stuck at ten to eleven or that weird looking boat that's supposed to bring luck into the family. But we worked out something in the end and I got to take down some walls, placed a new floor that keeps the house super cool in summer, and basically changed all the furniture in the house. 

That boat stayed on though. ;P

My mother is based in Madrid and has been working as a local tour guide for VIP groups from Asian countries and brings them all over Spain, sometimes even to Morocco, Portugal and France. Though tiring she loves her job and meeting people. My sister and I don't stay in Spain normally so she's happy to have company with at the apartment if she's not away on tour.

If you book with us please take care of the house and treat it as your own. I have prepared a guide to give you an overview of the city. If we are at home we'll be happy to help you with planning so you make the most of your stay in the city :)
